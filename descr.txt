You are a honey badger. You live in sub-saharan Africa, and you are a crasy, nastyass motherfucker. You are going to eat and kill other animals. But wait! Someone somewhere decided life was too easy for you, you crazy bastard, the rest of the animals in the savannah have gained the ability to fire laser beams. I guess god or whoever thought you were badass enough that you didn't need them. On the other hand, if you find a beehive, you become three times as large and invulnerable to lasers. So you have that going for you.

Go forth and feast upon the blood of your enemies.
