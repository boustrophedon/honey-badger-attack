game "board"
	rectangle, taller than wide

	desert/savannah motif

	map is same width as board, but is much longer
	goal is to get to the end of the map
		since you are a honey badger you don't give a fuck and can walk past most enemies if you want
		maybe some enemies/mini bosses (king cobras?) you have to defeat before you can advance?

you: 
	- honey badger
	- square starting at bottom of screen
	- you can move anywhere on the screen, with arrow keys

	- it would be too easy if you had laser beams too, so you just have a melee attack
	- special avoid lasers move: burrow. 

	- since you are a badass you can take several hits before you die i.e. you have health
	- restore health by devouring the corpses of other animals

other animals:
	- cobras
	- rats, lizards, birds
	- jackals, lions, cheetas
		- can't kill
		- can scare off with melee attacks because you're a motherfucking honey badger and you don't give a shit
	- beehives 
		- powerup if you break
		- bees don't hurt you but they do hurt enemies?

	all besides bees fire lasers at you, some if provoked (smaller animals, cheetahs and lions), some on sight (cobras, jackals)

	- mini bosses?

	- for now they are just different colored rectangles, i guess

controls:
	arrow keys, space bar
